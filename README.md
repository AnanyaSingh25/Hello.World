I have created a basic website using HTML, PHP, Javascript, MySQL and CSS. It has been hosted using AWS.
1. index.php - contains HTML and CSS queries.
2. style.css - contains the styling of the page.
3. db_connect.php - used to connect the database to the website.
4. script.js - contains javascript code to implement hovering.
